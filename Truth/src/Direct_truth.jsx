 <br /><br />
 For those who have the DNA to not waste Time. <br /><br /><br />
 The only thing that “works” <br /><br />
 Is the only that Exists. <br /><br />
 And that is: Truth. <br /><br /><br />
 A man’s time on this Earth is short. <br /><br />
 There is no time for conjecture, debate, opinion, belief, tips, tricks, hacks, and prescriptions. <br /><br />
 The only time is Now. <br /><br />
 The only thing is Truth. <br /><br /> <br />
 Those who gift these Podcasts to their employees, board members, institution, professional sports franchises, family, and friends are advised to Prepare the individuals before listening to them. <br /><br />
 By informing them that there is Nothing for them “to do.” To simply Exposure the words To their Mind, Brain, and Heart. <br /><br />
 Warning: A repeated Exposure to these podcasts will create shifts in the pattern of the Mind. <br /><br />
 Transformation happens quietly, within the foundation and deep and mysterious corners of the Human Organism. <br /><br />
 The Human may begin to notice alterations in his way of being. As Mind unrooted from its decades-long resting spot within the Human. <br /><br />
 Namaste. <br /><br /><br />
