        For the rarest of humans. <br /><br />
        The human who seeks to Arrive. <br /><br />
        No practice. No prescriptions. No work. No struggle. <br /><br />
        Simply, an Arrival to whatever he has been seeking his entire life. <br /><br />
        Once, and for all. <br /><br /><br />
        If in podcast form, it must be played on numerous occasions.<br /><br />

If in written form, it must be read numerous times.<br /><br />

In order to provide a repeated exposure to the Mind.<br /><br />
Pledges begin in the Seven-Figures per Arrival System.<br /><br />

Until now, these Journeys were made available only to a select few in secret.<br /><br />

One must apply for them, expressing why it is that he seeks to obtain it. He must submit his pledge. If he is Accepted, he is notified in short order.<br /><br />

The audio file/written document is sent to him via electronic email.<br /><br />

 

All human problems have no “treatment.”<br /><br /><br />

They have only a Cure.<br /><br />

<h4>The Arrival: Freedom from Anxiety</h4> <br />
In order to arrive at freedom from anxiety, one must learn the true source of anxiety. Where it is born. How it poisons the Mind, and overcomes the human.<br /><br />

When a man becomes free of anxiety, circumstances of life begin to lose their hold upon him. He is no longer imprisoned by “unforeseen events.”<br /><br />

The possibility of failure no longer affects him. This allows him a great freedom.<br /><br />

The Freedom to create, and to act in a way that recruits from him the peak of his abilities.<br /><br />

For his abilities are no longer hijacked by anxiousness and anticipation.<br /><br />

When there is no gap, no hesitation, between intention and action, there is true power.<br /><br /><br />
<h4>The Arrival: Becoming A Legend In Your Field</h4><br />
In order to become a legend in your field, one must understand that practice, technique, and instruction do not create legends. For this is not what they are made for.<br /><br />

A legend is beyond the purview of all traditional means.<br /><br />

The training is on an entirely different level. The approach is beyond the understanding of the conventional mind.<br /><br />

It is a becoming, rather than a doing. An emergence, rather than a chase.<br /><br />

A human is capable of truly otherworldly things.<br /><br />

In order to achieve, he must be willing to go to another world.<br /><br /><br />

 

 

There are many more such podcasts/writings. Many more topics. That span all human problems. That provide the secrets to bring a human to the Ultimate.<br /><br />

Such things are not available anywhere in the modern world.<br /><br />

The humans who seek them, to large measure, are not either.<br /><br />
