       <b>The Private Discourses</b> are private letters that expose the Mind of the reader to Truth. <br /><br />
       Truths that they will seldom find anywhere in the world. <br /><br />
       It is exposure that Transforms a human. <br /><br />
       <b>The Siddha Scrolls</b> are a higher tier of letter. <br /><br />
       Both require a substantial monthly pledge in order to be considered. <br /><br />
       Both are released several times per month via direct email. <br /><br />
       Pledges may be submitted to Kapil@KapilGuptaMD.com. <br /><br />
       These are only for those who are Serious and Devoted. <br /><br />
