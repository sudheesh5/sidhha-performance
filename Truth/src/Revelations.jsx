        <p id="description">
        This is a series of Private Documents that systematically reveal The Truths of a human life. <br /> <br />
        One may discover in these pages the closest approximation to a True Manual of human living anywhere in existence. <br /><br />
        Explanations are given. But not as extensively and deeply as The Siddha Arrivals, and the 6-figure writings whose titles have been released in my Twitter stream. <br /><br />
        What a given individual is searching for, and what his interiority resonates with is unique to each human being. <br /> <br />
        A variety of Truths are revealed, from all aspects of human life, and world class performance. <br /><br />
        Truths from various elements of human life, from performance to parenting to relationship to the mind, and numerous aspects of a human life are revealed. <br /><br />
        As with all of my Private Writings, things are revealed as they are. <br /><br />
        Thus, it is not for those who seek cosmetic views, pick-me-ups, and prescriptive instructions. <br /><br />
        Raw Truths. Stated just as they are. <br /><br /><br />
        If one finds themselves Ready and deeply interested, they may apply with a letter to Kapil@KapilGuptaMD.com <br /><br />
        Each Document in the series requires a minimum of a mid-5-figure pledge in USD. <br /><br />
        Those Accepted will be notified via email. <br /><br /><br />
        Namaste. <br /><br />
